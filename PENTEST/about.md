## ASCII art

The ASCII art has been made with the web tool: https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/

With the `slant` font and horizontal spacing set to wide and vertical settings set to normal. Tried out some other fancy ASCII art, but does not seem to be 100% compatible with all kind of devices.
