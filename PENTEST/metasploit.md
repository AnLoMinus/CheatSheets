# Metasploit

Metasploit in one of the Swiss army toys that can do a lot of things. Starting from network discovery with its inbuilt `nmap` scan feature up to searching for exploits, up to exploiting the target computer.

**When we want to use Metasploit for the first time since you booted your system, in a console as root users, run:**

    msfdb init

Start up metasploit in a console:

    msfconsole

The first thing you need to remember is that you can easily get help in the `msfconsole` by typing `help`. With the `help` feature you should get your way.

Search for some module, for example `samba`:

    search <keyword>

Then use the module. You can type in the module name or the line number as argument for `use`:

    use <module-name>

Look to what options you can / need to set:

    show options

Look maybe also to the `show advanced` options:

Set the option. Use setg if you want to set it clobally.

    set <some-option>

Execute the exploit:

    run
