## Embedding data to a jpeg or bmp file with steghide

Steghide only support jpeg and bmp image files. However, we can embed whatever type of file.

```
echo "This is my secret message" > secret_message.txt
```

Now to embed this text file to our image file.

````commandline
steghide embed -cf my_photo.jpeg -ef secret_message.txt
````

## Extracting data from a jpeg or bmp file with steghide

With `steghide`:

````commandline
steghide extract extract -sf my_photo.jpeg
````

With `binwalk`:

    binwalk -D='.*' PurpleThing.jpeg

Which is the same command as:

    binwalk --dd='.*' PurpleThing.jpeg

Or even binwalk -e
